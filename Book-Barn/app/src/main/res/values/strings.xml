    <string name="book_barn_empowers_children">BookBarn was created to empower children to take ownership over their own reading experiences. BookBarn also motivates students to increase independent reading time and build accountability for what they are reading.</string>
    <string name="whats_next">Book Barn is currently working on some awesome features! Soon users will be able to create and store their information in a private account. Users will eventually be able to create classrooms, select a specific grade level, and receive student questions that pertain to that particular grade level. We will also provide the guided reading book level so that users can easily track which book levels students are reading the most often.</string>
    <string name="about_us">Book Barn was created by an elementary school teacher named Audrey in San Francisco. Audrey knows that students are motivated to read when they are reading about topics that inspire and interest them. Students are also empowered when they are able to show off all that they have read. Audrey made this app with everything she believes excellent literacy education to currently be and with hope for what it will be in the future.</string>
    <string name="ps">And of course, Audrey also made this app with love for all of her students who have inspired and brought her happiness throughout the years.</string>

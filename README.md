# Book-Barn

Book Barn was created to empower children to take over their own reading experiences. It motivates students to increase independent reading time and build accountability for what they are reading.
 
 App Features include:
 
 1. Ability to create your own classroom
 2. Personalize your students/class
 3. Allow students/user to scan a book into their library with a book ISBN
 4. Sketch their favorite part of the story
 5. Rate the book
 6. Users can also view their classroom and see how many book their students have read
 
 
 What's Next? Some app features that we are still working on:
 1. Ability to have a user login and password
 2. Save student work in a way that allows students to go back and look at their old work
 3. Incorporating additional feedback from UI/UX designers to adjust flow and look of the app
 4. Organizing students alphabetically or by classroom number
 5. Including student/book reading levels
